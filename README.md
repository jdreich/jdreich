### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent Ph.D. graduate specializing in a range of statistical and machine learning methods to solve real-world problems. This is a personal site to showcase types of projects I've worked on and associated code, primarily in R and Python. Some examples include:
- microbiome analyses of airborne fungi using ITS1 amplicon sequences
- machine learning algorithms to predict the occurrence of airborne fungal spores based on the environmental conditions
- statistial analyses of crop disease surveys

... and hopefully much more in the future!

Feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions ðŸ¤
